# IRIS-Classifiction
This is a hello word of the machine learning.
Iris dataset is having four main parameter like SepalLengthCm, SepalWidthCm, PetalLengthCm, PetalWidthCm.
We have to classify Species based on this parameter for this we are going to use algorithm like Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Support vector Machine, Knear Neighbors. 

## List of Library required 
1. Numpy - For matrics manipulation 
2. Pandas - importing data from the csv file to variable
3. matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn - Visulize the data 
4. Scikit learn - Train the model 

## Steps for the Train Model
1. First import the data from the csv file using the pandas function read_csv()
2. Visualize the data with the help of the matplotlib and seaborn
3. Check whether your data need to regression or classification algorithm 
4. Now apply first simple algorithm from scikit learn library
5. check the accuracy and then try another algorithm to achieve higher accuracy
